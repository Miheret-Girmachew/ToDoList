# React Todo List Application

## Project Description

This is a simple and responsive Todo List application built using React.  It allows users to:

*   Add new tasks.
*   Mark tasks as "Undone", "In Progress", or "Done".
*   Filter tasks based on their status (All, Undone, In Progress, Done, Completed, Pending).


The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for managing your daily tasks. It organizes tasks into three main sections: Undone, In Progress, and Done, making it easy to track your progress.
